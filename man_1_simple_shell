Name
Simple Shell

Description

This is a simplified implementation of a basic shell, which is a command line interpreter for Unix systems. The shell reads commands from standard input and executes them. Since it is a simple version, it has limited functionality and only supports certain built-in functions. This project was developed as the end-of-trimester project for ALX.

Invocation:

To start an interactive simple shell, you can type ./hsh. On the other hand, a non-interactive shell can be invoked using a pipe. For example, echo ls | ./hsh.

Command execution:

When a command is received, the following steps are taken if it is a simple command with optional arguments.

If the command does not contain any slashes, the shell searches for a function with that name and executes it. If no match is found, the shell looks for the command in the built-in functions. If the command is found as a built-in, it is executed.

If there is still no match at this point, the shell searches each directory specified in the environment variable PATH for an executable file with the command name. If the search yields no results, the shell displays an error message.

Built-ins:

exit: Terminates the process, with an optional exit status.
env: Prints the current environment.
setenv: Modifies or adds an environment variable.
unsetenv: Deletes a variable from the environment.
